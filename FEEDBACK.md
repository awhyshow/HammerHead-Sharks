# Feedback

## First iteration

### Good stuff:

- Code is very clean, easy to follow, and thorough! Also some nice tricks I haven't seen before. J'adore!
- It may sound like little good stuff but you should see the number of "Nice" comments in the notebook ahaha
- Adding a meme for flavour: https://imgflip.com/i/abj8n9

### To improve:

- Would make a few more sections in the Jupyter notebook and order them with the hashtags (#)!
- Create intermediate data files!
- Rename Jupyter notebook - it should be `data-cleaning`, not `shark-attack`, as you want separate notebooks for separate steps of the analysis process.

### For next time:

- Make sure that the notebook has been run from top to bottom! At times I couldn't see the output of some cells and ideally I should be able to see what each cell did (easier to give feedback on it in case I cannot reproduce the error)
- Use your initials for notebooks + the task you are working on instead of just your names, e.g. 01-sf-data-cleaning.ipynb. Numbering should be based on the relevant number of the task in the whole process.

P.S. More specific feedback in the `Shark-attacks-feedback.ipynb` notebook! Search for "SABINA COMMENT".
