# HammerHead Shark Project

## Project goal:

1.  Our project goal is to focus on the research and analyze shark attacks depending on:

- Activities;
- Date of attack;
- Geographical Location;
- Fatality;
- Injury type;
- Weather.

2.  Create a solution to prevent shark attacks.

## Why focus on this topics to analyze the shark attacks?

We believe that if we create an App that warns in real time the shark attack dangers to institutions, tourism establishments and public services we can drasticly decrease the shark attack reports and incidents.

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** Shark Attack excell file (GSAF5.xls)
- Contains historical records of shark attacks, including date, location, activity, fatality, injury and other attack details.

# Project Structure:

# Project Workflow:

1. Data Loading & Cleaning:

   - Import and clean the shark attack dataset
   - Handle missing values and inconsistent entries

2. Feature Analysis:

   - Examine relationships between activity type, location, time, and severity
   - Integrate weather data using the _Meteostat_ API

3. Visualization:

   - Interactive charts and maps using Plotly for better insight exploration

4. Insights & Solution Proposal:
   - Identify key patterns in shark attacks;
   - Propose a **real-time warning system app** as a solution.
